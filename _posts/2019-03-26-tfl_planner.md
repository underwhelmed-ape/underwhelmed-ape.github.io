London Underground Planner
---------------------------------


This was a project initially created during an excellent <a href="https://foundersandcoders.com/" target="_blank">Founders and Coders</a> Weekend Coders workshop on using APIs. This planner uses JQuery to interrogate the Transport for London API, and use [moment.js](http://momentjs.com/) to turn the extracted times from the API into human readable results.

This shows the trains due to arrive at Bethnal Green tube station, their ETA and final destination.

Using TfL API with JQuery and Javascript.

The site can be found <a href="https://underwhelmed-ape.github.io/tfl_planner/" target="_blank">here</a> and the Github repository <a href="https://github.com/underwhelmed-ape/tfl_planner" target="_blank">here</a>
