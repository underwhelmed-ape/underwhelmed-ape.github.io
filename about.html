        <p>
          I am currently a Data Scientist for a data company in the Agro-food industry at Rothamsted Research Institute, UK. </p>
        <p>
          I began my career as a scientific researcher. I loved been able to see beyond what just my eyes could see. Seeing a beauty on other dimensions as Richard Feynman said.
            <br/>
          Science and the quantitative arts is, I believe, a highly creative endevour. Discoveries are not seen with the eye anymore, they are seen with the mind. To deduce what has never been seen before takes thinking...

            <br />

          This portfolio is a way for me to keep the tools of my trade sharp as well as to document my projects. Along the way, like all creatives, I hope to get a sense of what truly motivates me and of the topics that excite me. </p>
