        <p>
          I am currently a Data Scientist for a big data centre in the Agro-food industry based at Rothamsted Research Institute, UK.
          Previously a Statistician in the public sector, I started in academia as a researcher in Soil Science and Material Engineering.

          Infobesity describes the overwhelming accumulation of information and materials bringing the feeling of having too much choice.
          Ironically applicable to learning data science, a topic about condensing large amounts of data into useful information,
          this abundance of choice and styles of learning can often hinder progress.

          Learning data science has been and continues to be a steep learning curve.
          Moving from a scientific background, improving my knowledge about statistics and learning to code has taken many hours and much of my spare time.
          This site is to document the pathway of topics and the personal projects I have undertaken broaden my data science skillsets
          and hopfully act as a reminder to my future self. My interests at the moment lie in machine learning and computer vision.
