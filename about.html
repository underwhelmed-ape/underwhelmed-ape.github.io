        <p>
          I am currently a Data Scientist for a data company in the Agro-food industry at Rothamsted Research Institute, UK.
        </p>

        <p>
          Infobesity is the overwhelming accumulation of information and materials bringing the feeling of too much choice. Ironically applicable to data science, a topic that attempts to condense large amounts of data into understandable decisions.
        </p>

        <p>
          Learning data science has been a steep learning curve for me. Moving from a scientific background, improving my statistics knowledge and learning to code has taken many hours and much of my spare time.
        </p>

        <p>
          This site is to document the personal projects I undertake on Data Science topics as an opportunity to broaden my skillset and hopfully act as a reminder to my future self. My interests lie in machine learning and computer vision. and the things I read / used in the plethora of materials out there to help my understanding.
        </p>

        <p>
          You will also find here, in time, projects of a different kind that interest me such as making and artwork.
        </p>

        <p>
          More about me can be found on my linked in site.
